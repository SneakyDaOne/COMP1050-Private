The juypter file appears to be observing the data values of an accelerometer 
placed around 4 certain locations on a human body (Wrist, chest, ankle and hip)
The 24th labeled row is considered an activity number in which the 13 activities
are labeled as such with value data based around the 13 activities.

The second visual display data appears to be compiling all accelerometer data
for the sitting activity (1) and chose to display and plot all datapoints from 
the rows 500 to 1499 with only the first 2 columns and display said data as a graph.

Graph number 3 is smoothing out the data from the second graph using a signal filter.

Display point number 4 is simply the point of which the average min and max values are displayed.
